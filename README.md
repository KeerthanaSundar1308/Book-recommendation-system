# Book-recommendation-system

A book recommendation system was developed which does the following:

Fan Favourites:
Lists the fan favourites (top 50 books). To make the choices more credible, only the books that have more than 50 ratings and the ratings of users who have given more than 200 ratings were considered in the selection process.

Recommend Books:
The model will recommend 7 similar books based on the book title entered. 

Dataset was sourced form Kaggle
